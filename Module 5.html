         	<h2>Module 5</h2>
            <p> <img src="images/boxPic06.jpg" alt="" class="floatPic">""This week was relatively challenging week for me I must say as I made some mistakes and stuffed up the frequency code repeatedly and had a hard time understanding the chessboard but I got it eventually! This week's time management allocated fairly poorly I must say due to the pressure of the exams from my other subjects which caused the neglecting of computing activities. My craftsmanship and teamwork skills are still on an upward trend as I implemented more teamwork strategies especially because of the task 2b assignment and my code is more easily decipherable!<br><br>
             	This week, we got our Task 2B assignment and we decided that for the most efficient approach towards the assignment, we should split the assignment into different parts and finish our individual components and then collate the parts together. That way we would save more time and will able to finish the assignment more quickly! In our tutelab, we also examined the difference in compiling methods that resulted in different storage locations of arrays, it was pretty interesting and insightful!<br><br>
                Throughout this hectic week I feel like my C level and Craftsmanship has improved once more however my time management may deteriorated a little beause of the fact that I may have stressed too much over my exams but overalll I managed to complete everything and learnt quite alot this weeek especially in regards to time management and not learning everything to the last minute. "<br><br>
                Current C Level: still basic?? <br><br>

               Current Craftsmanship: Easily intrepretable!!</p>
               <h3>Improvement</h3>
               <p>(1) More planning was implemented<br><br> 
               (2)Teamwork skills improved <br><br>
               (3)Compiling Skills<br><br>
               <h3>Plan</h3>
               <p> Start Developing base for something awesome...</p>
