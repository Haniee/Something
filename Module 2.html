        	<h2>Module 2 ~ Humble Beginnigs </h2>
            <p><img src="images/boxPic1.jpg" alt="" class="floatPic">"This week's module is possibly one of the most challenging modules for me as many activities were quite tedious and required all the aspects of teamwork, artisanship and time management.<br><br>
            First of all, the teamwork required in both of tutelab activities to ensure that the activities were completed to satisfactory degree. I cannot thank my lab partner Henna for supporting and helping me through the explore memory activity, without her I don't think I would have survived and passed through the activity. Two brains is always better than one! <br><br>
          Whereas, the amount of artisanship needed in these modules activity was cruical to completion of many activities especially the tutelab activity where the code was presented to us in such a mess that it was impossible to decipher what the code was actually about. With guidance from the C style guide, we were able to clear up the code in a much better format that was made the code much more comprehendible.<br></br>
           The aspect of time management this time that was needed was different from previous modules since it was taken to a whole new level where simple management of time was not all that was required. What was also required was the evidence how well your time management was prior to this week!!!! A different game was being played now, like legal cases, every single claim/statement needed evidence. :O Luckily for me, I had kept blogs on previous lecture videos so I safely passed! phew<br></br>
           Current level of C: ability to compile basic functions and programs 

Current level of craftsmanship: ability to create a satisfactory and clear layout of code </p>
           
<p>Improvements</p>
<p>(1) C skills: </p>
<p>(2)Improve on craftsmanship </p>
<p>(3)Regularly meet up with lab partner to work on tutelab activities</p>
<p>(4) Read through other resumes for ideas on something awesome</p>
