         	<h2>Module 4 </h2>
            <p><img src="images/boxPic_4.jpg" alt="" class="floatPic">"This week has yet again challenged my abilities of time management skills as this week proved to be more of a challenge than the other weeks with the added on pressure from the additional tasks that were assessable. To be able to correctly allocate my time, I chose to weigh the various tasks according to their importance and as a result, I decided to complete the two assessable tasks; the time management resume and the something awesome proposal came first. However, I must say this week's biggest challenge was the 8005's sets because of the intense planning and testing needed to complete the tasks. In comparison to the C, creating functions in microprocessors was much harder as it needed more basic commands. .<br><br>
           This week we also changed tutelab partners so I got a new partner so now I get to work with someone new! I also found out that we are both not the best at C, so during our struggle to create both of the tutelab activities, we actually learnt quite a lot by assisting each other with other perspectives and differences in knowledge. <br><br>
           Once again, craftsmanship played a major role in the completion of various activities especially in SimpleEncode since I found out that after changing its structure in accordance to the C Style Format made it much clearer and I actually found the solution much faster after I changed the format of the code. Similarly, I found that keeping the code neat helped assist in my quest in completing the task. <br><br>
           I must say for the doomsday assignment I struggled quite a lot mainly due to the fact that I actually read the question wrong >.< This whole time, I thought we had to make a function that had to find the doomsday for the year!!!! BUT then I realised when i re-read the assignment that the doomsday was given all we had to create a function that given the doomsday then had to find out the day when given a date. I felt like the task just go so much simpler even though it would require some effort to solve, it actually didn't take as much effort as I thought it would.<br><br>
           NOTE TO SELF: Read the instructions of every assignment at least twice.<br><br>
           Over this week, I was taken a wild journey from web pages, calling functions, strings, lengths of strings, storage of strings to arrays. Arrays and strings were especially important in this week's lectures as these concepts are connected to the field of memory and the storage of different variables. <br><br>

 	This journey through this week has been a wild one and I anticipate more ones these to come but hopefully as I grow I will gain more control over these journeys and will struggle less and go with the flow!"<br><br>
    <h3>Improvements</h3>
    Craftsmanship has levelled up!<br><br>
    Knowledge of c especially strings has increased! </p>
    <h3>Plans</h3>
    <p>Increase C knowledge<br><br>
    Improve format of code by use of sublime </p>
