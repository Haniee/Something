         	<h2>Module 7 ~ Maintenance</h2>
            <p><img src="images/boxPic07.jpg" alt="" class="floatPic">"Overall, this week started on more positive note since we had the quiet week to prepare for the great storm that was storming towards id but it hasn't actually been that bad but like they say this is only the beginning...who knows what more is there to come?!<br><br>
            The lectures got into deeper content and despite Richard's numerous warnings about controlling one's emotions and I still fell into my own bed of self pity and became overwhelmed by my own stress levels, letting it fully take over my soul. But eventually I got over it.  And started slowly completing my various computing tasks. <br><br>
            I ALSO STARTED ON MY SOMETHING AWESOME PROJECT!!! So far I have something basic layout done and a blog post on the project is coming soon!!!! <br><br>
            My time management skills are also on an upward trend with everything falling back into place once more by completing everything by the due date and keeping a steady pace with my completion of various tasks. Next week I plan to complete every single task within the shortest time frame to keep myself at ease and hopefully this again improves my time management as I improve my game once more!<br><br>
            In relation to craftsmanship, I think I'm getting into better habits as it has become a habit to ensure that I get the code into a neat format so that it much easier for everyone to view the code and what is actually written within the code. <br><br>
            For teamwork, this week we got our group for the game project and we have collaborated a facebook chat group in order more easily communicate with each other. Also for the completion of this week's task, we organised to have a group meeting on sunday however I was unable to attend because I had other obligations :( but  we did also work together throughout the tutelab on Tuesday so I feel like I have actually contributed towards the completion of this week's tasks :)
This week hasn't been as bad as I have imagined it would be and I feel like as I progress on that IM ACTUALLY MAKING PROGRESS :) HEHEHEHEHE</p>
