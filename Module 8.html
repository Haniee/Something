         	<h2>Module 8 </h2>
            <p><img src="images/boxPic08.jpg" alt="" class="floatPic">"This week has been a pretty intense week again with overwhelming workload especially from coming from my other courses as well and also because I keep falling asleep by accident T^T and thus no work is done. I must say however the project is going pretty well despite the small struggles at the beginning of the project. :) <br><br>
            This week's time management has improved SLIGHTLY with my completion of all tasks on time and some of the tasks earlier than the due date. I shall aim for next week to have all tasks maybe nearly a week in advance so that there is more time to check for mistakes and make sure that the task is completed adequately.<br><br>
            Craftsmanship is as wonderful as ever ~ nowadays I can clearly identify mistakes in the code by quickly skimming through the code to find where the mistakes are ;DDDD Currently looking through the CSE Style Guide to find on more areas to improve, will write a blog post on this if I find more areas to improve on craftsmanship.<br><br>
            On the negative side, I feel like our teamwork has deteriorated as our channels of communications has seem to broken down with the lack of responses that are accumulated from the facebook group chat especially in urgent times. We had organised a group meeting on Friday and everyone had been notified beforehand yet 2 members of our group were missing!!! :( To improve on our teamwork skills, I feel like we need to regularly communicate on the group chat so that everyone is kept updated and make sure that everyone is well informed if any of team members cannot make it to the team meetings. <br><br>
            In relations to agile programming, I feel like this approach is much better since it is less overwhelming and allows for more room for improvement and understanding towards the program. It allows us to take the programming experience one step at a time rather than taking that great leap across the other side of the bridge and hoping we make that jump.<br><br>

This approach also allows for the program to be designed much better since overtime, most of its flaws will be taken in account and will taken care of!  "</p>
