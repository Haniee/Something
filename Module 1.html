         	<h2>Module 1 ~ Humble Beginnigs </h2>
            <p><img src="images/boxPic1.jpg" alt="" class="floatPic">"This module challenged my creative or should I say lack of creative skill, my craftsmanship and my time management skills. From the shortening the deadline by 2 days to demanding an impressive image of a dragon was everything I was not prepared for; it seems that cs1917 is becoming more of a platform where people have the ability to showcase their creative skills. Whereas, my lack of such skills is killing me, it is one of few things thats preventing me from sprinting across the finish line at the end of the week with full speed. But...I've made it!!!! ^_^ [not without falling down pretty badly though :( ] .<br><br>
            A chance was given for people to showcase was in the task given to print out an image of a dragon by use of  all sorts of symbols, numbers and letters. I struggled to conjure an image of a dragon from scratch so I resorted to using google images to enlighten me on how a dragon and simply traced the image.  It wasn't that bad looking but it wasn't that impressive either; just quite mediocre. <br><br>
           The hardest obstacle in this path so far I must say was the isLeapYear function and it wasn't even because I did not understand the concept and couldn't figure how to write code. It was because of my horrible grammar skills. Multiple times the program refused to compile simply because of missing symbols or missing declarations. During this process I reached an epiphany; I realised how important craftsmanship was, it was essentially vital to the program. In my program where I had attempted to save a bit of time by leaving out some distinctions between different areas of code. It become impossible to read and fix especially in my case since my mistakes were quite recognisable or noticeable.<br></br>
           The functions of c must be precise, declared, can have multiple inputs but only has one ouput for any input. There are also partial functions which are the functions that can be undefined for some variables, as a result the program may cease to take the inputs it knows that the program cannot take the input. <br><br>
           As the modules take higher levels of programming, my C programming level is also increasing and I'm no longer that baby who looks at the bright and shiny world not knowing what everything it is. Taking my baby steps, I am gradually able to see more of this shiny world where I will learn to find my own place where I will understand maybe not everything but hopefully the majority of the workings of C programming." </p>
           
<p>PLANS</p>
<p>(1) Work on programming skills especially C skills, revise on activities and improve c programming skills</p>
<p>(2)Improve on craftsmanship </p>
<p>(3)Regularly meet up with lab partner to work on tutelab activities</p>
<p>(4) Read through other resumes for ideas on something awesome</p>
