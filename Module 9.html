            <p><img src="images/boxPic09.jpg" alt="" class="floatPic">"During this week's module, I felt that I had more of a grip on my life and I'm no longer being pushed forward by the numerous of the deadlines of the many assessments and projects. This must be a sign that my time management is improving and I'm finally reaching a slight upward trend. This week I managed to finish all the activities with abit of time leftover to check over my programs for the small errors that I might have possibly missed. I was able to blog more this week as well, with my blog per week increasing from the usual 2 to 4. This drastic change in the number of blogs further demonstrates my increased efficiency in time management!!! :)<br><br>
            In regards to this week's teamwork, we managed to work together as a team for the project game to expand the capabilities of the game.c and increased the number of testGame.c tests to test more components of the Game.c. Our teamwork for AI was through use of the suggestion of the ideas and the collaboration of code was quite efficient too despite our poor ranking <br><br>

Our teamwork for AI was through use of the suggestion of the ideas and the collaboration of code was quite efficient too despite our poor ranking which mainly due to a straight mistake in the component for obtaining the arc and hence, we were only able to perform spinoffs.<br><br>
